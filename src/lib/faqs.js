    },

      question: "Is the CRS result an official IRCC decision?",

    {
      question: "What does the PNP eligibility check assess?",

    },
    {
      question: "Does a PNP result guarantee a nomination?",
      answer: "No. Provincial programs have their own criteria, invitations and document requirements. Use the result as a starting point for a more detailed assessment.",

    {
      question: "Do I need every document before requesting an assessment?",
      answer: "No. Start with the information you have. The assessment can help you understand which documents and facts will matter most before you prepare the full application.",
